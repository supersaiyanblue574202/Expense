Here is a detailed step-by-step guide for your specific script:

Step-by-Step Guide
Install PyInstaller:

bash
Copy code
pip install pyinstaller
Save Your Script:
Save your script as expense_save.py.

Run PyInstaller:
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing your script. Run:

bash
Copy code
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed expense_save.py
Check the Output:
After the process completes, you will see several new directories and files created by PyInstaller. The most important one is the dist directory, which contains the expense_save executable.

Package and Distribute:

Navigate to the dist directory:
bash
Copy code
cd dist
You should see the expense_save executable. You can now share this file with others.
Example Directory Structure
lua
Copy code
/your-project
  |-- expense_save.py
  |-- /build
  |-- /dist
      |-- expense_save
  |-- expense_save.spec
  |-- data.csv
Important Notes
Include Required Files: If your application relies on other files (e.g., data.csv), make sure to include them in the same directory as the executable or adjust your script to access these files from a relative path.
Testing: Test the executable on a different machine (if possible) to ensure that it runs correctly without any dependencies or additional setup.
Cross-Platform: If you need executables for different operating systems, you must run PyInstaller on each target OS. For example, create a Windows executable on a Windows machine and a macOS executable on a macOS machine.
